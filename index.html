        <h2>The Bees Knees</h2>
        <p>
          The Bees Knees is a pop rock band originating from San Francisco,
          California. The band consists of lead vocalist Bryan Teddy, guitarist
          Mack Tolkens, guitarist Andrew Green, bassist Kent Zulkee and drummer
          Freddie Fischer. The band achieved its first commercial success as an
          unsigned act, drawing attention from manager Cam Adams. Having worked
          with other popular acts (The Elephant In The Room, One Trick Pony, The
          Cat’s Meow), Adams was confident the band could succeed even further,
          pushing them to sign with Magenta Records. From there, the band has
          soared, gaining international recognition and ranking in the top 10 on
          the Poster Charts. New fans immediately fell in love with the band’s
          original and organic attitude, solidifying their place as one of the
          hottest and fastest up and coming acts of this century. Fans
          affectionately refer to themselves as “The Hive” and are drawn to
          their candid and authentic performances on stage. Looking forward to
          touring in the future, The Bees Knees are currently recording their
          second studio album, looking to be released in late 2021.
